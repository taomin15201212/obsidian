I've developed an AI Navigator landing page with an interactive AI Explorer component. The page features a modern white theme with blue accents, following the requirements. How do you find the design and layout? Does the interactive AI Explorer demo component work as expected? Can you navigate through the different sections like Features, Explorer, Testimonials, and FAQ using the header navigation?
